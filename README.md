# 107e-final
final project from the Stanford course cs107e

# This is an emulation of the PICO-8 fantasy console on bare-metal Raspberry Pi.
The PICO-8 screen resolution and color palette have been both translated onto the Raspberry Pi. In addition, the client interface in PICO-8 has been kept as loyally as possible so that developing in this library feels almost identical to developing with PICO-8.

# This is the skeleton of a top-down Zelda-like -- on Raspberry Pi.
In this version, input, movement, collision, enemy behavior, and animations are all functional. This depends on the Raspberry Pi module coded in the course CS107e for graphics.

# Context
This project was completed with a partner at the end of CS107e Computer Systems from the Ground Up. CS107e is a renowned course in which students learn systems programming on a bare-metal Raspberry Pi. The first 8 weeks of the course revolve around developing a module to interface with the Pi, including a console, shell, and graphics library. String functions like printf are also coded from scratch, as well as a backtrace function.
